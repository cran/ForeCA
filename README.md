# ForeCA R package

[![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/ForeCA)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ForeCA)


**ForeCA** implements *Forecastable component analysis* in R.  For details on algorithm & methodology see [*Forecastable Component Analysis*, JMLR, Goerg (2013)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/goerg13.pdf).


**In a nutshell:** *ForeCA* finds linear combinations
of multivariate time series that are most forecastable, where forecastability is measured by the spectral entropy of the resulting signal (linear combination of input).


## Installation

**UPDATE**: As of 2020-06-09 **ForeCA** has been removed from CRAN, because
the **ifultools** / **sapa** dependecies are no longer maintained.  I am working
on an update to **ForeCA** to not rely on these packages, but only rely on **astsa**
for multivariate specturm estimation. See `NEWS.md` for details.

In the meantime you can install the ForeCA package directly from
github as
```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("gmgeorg/ForeCA")
```

**Temporarily not working**

You can install the stable version on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ForeCA):

```r
install.packages('ForeCA')
```

## Usage

The workhorse function is `ForeCA::foreca()` which works just like the built-in `princomp` function for PCA. 

```{r}
library(ForeCA)
citation("ForeCA")
```

For a tutorial on how to use `foreca()` and the entire **ForeCA** suite of functions see the [introductory vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ForeCA/vignettes/Introduction.html) on CRAN.
